# Secure Access Control System

## Overview
This project implements a secure access control system using **NFC authentication** and **facial recognition**. It enhances security by encrypting sensitive data and efficiently managing task execution through a real-time scheduling approach.

## Features
- **NFC Authentication**: Uses an NFC reader to verify authorized access cards.
- **Facial Recognition**: Captures and matches faces against stored reference images.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures secure storage and transmission of access credentials.
- **Real-time Task Scheduling**: Manages authentication and access processes efficiently.
- **Access Control Indicators**: Provides visual and audio feedback for access status using LEDs and a buzzer.
- **Event Logging**: Captures images of granted and denied access attempts for record-keeping.

## Usage
1. Run the access control system:
2. Place an NFC card near the reader.
3. If authorized, the system captures an image and verifies the face.
4. Access is granted or denied based on authentication results.
